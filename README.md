IntAL (Integer of Arbitrary Length)
C Library of functions to compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation (positive exponent) of integers of arbitrary length. Alibrary to implement and process integer of very large lengths.

All the basic arithmetic functions are implemented as described below,
Addition and Subtraction are done using brute force. Multiplication is done using fast multiplication using karatsuba multiplication algorithm. Division is done using a modified brute force algorithm (Number of subtractions reduced by adding multiplications by 10). Exponentiation is done by repeated multiplication.
